# Thermal-Consuction

The purpose of this project was to calculated and simulate the spread of the heat using heat equation for 2 dimensional system.
Firstly, we calculated the discrete form of 2 dimensional Heat equation. 
Then, we defined a function in Python for 2D heat equation. 
Then, we created a mesh-grid with linspace and used it to analyse the difference between analytical and computer simulation solutions.
At the end, we applied time evolution to the system and created an animation of it in ".gif" form.
